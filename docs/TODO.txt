TO DO LIST:

+Prompt user to enter email on first use -Felix

+Only display "Edit Task" And "Delete" Buttons for myTasks - cant edit 
	other users tasks - AJ

+Set up file storage -AJ

-Set up online connection stuff -Chance (How is this going anyways? almost done?)

+(Possibly) change model for photos and audio so that the content is 
	stored as a file URL instead of Bitmap or AudioClip -Felix "photos are saved in sdcard, Gallery"



-We need to document our code better. we're losing out on some easy marks here

-Test cases - more easy marks (lets at least shoot for satisfactory)

-OOD - update UML - AJ

-release planning - everyone (add whatever seems too large to finish, or too tedious)

-requirements

-refactoring

*** We need to focus on croudsourcing before part 4 is finished. more focus 
	on multiple user situations and less on implementation.

Put your ccid beside any of the items you want to work on, and add anything
I haven't put here yet.

+mark finished stuff with a plus



future release planning:
-Allow user to edit/change email
-Set up email notifications for user confirmation and fulfillment confirmation
