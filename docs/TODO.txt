TO DO LIST:

-Prompt user to enter email on first use
-Allow user to change email - affects database on a large scale, as the 
	email will need to be changed in the database
-Only display "Edit Task" And "Delete" Buttons for myTasks - cant edit 
	other users tasks
-Set up file storage and online connection stuff
-(Possibly) change model for photos and audio so that the content is 
	stored as a file URL instead of Bitmap or AudioClip
-Set up email notifications for user confirmation and fulfillment confirmation

*** We need to focus on croudsourcing before part 4 is finished. more focus 
	on multiple user situations and less on implementation.

Put your ccid beside any of the items you want to work on, and add anything
I haven't put here yet.
